### Description
I'm working for Project Manager and Android Programmer on this project. Wealthiva is an advanced development of Wealthify since Wealthify was discontinued for development. Wealthiva has the same vision as Wealthify which is to help everyone to manage their finances well. Although it has the same vision but this project was developed with a new design by implementing the concept of **gamification** and target user customization. This project uses Firebase as server to provide microservice requirements like authentication, database, etc. This project has been published on Play Store, you can check it here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.codeiva.wealthiva. By the way, the image that I uploaded on the top is the old one, Wealthiva is always developing, just try the application.
