### Description
This website is my personal website, built with Gatsby. I did not built it from stratch, but using starter pack. I use my free time to learn NodeJS and Gatsby with some practices like this project. I always maintain this website, but you can check this web that already deployed here using Netlify: https://lordfarhan.me.
